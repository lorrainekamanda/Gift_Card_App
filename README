# Introduction

This is a  Wishlist Api Django rest Framework project that focuses on the CRUD functionalities of Restful Api..

## Resources
The following are the resources used by the project:

  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for virtual development environment and easy deployment
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/restless-comet-828898/workspace/79251e69-defb-48e5-bdb8-184ced38e113/overview) -For Api    documentation


## Prerequisites
As a prerequisite please make sure you have the following tools already installed on your machine:
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```sh
$ python3 -m venv virtual

```

## Installing and using the app using Django!
1. Clone this repo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lorrainekamanda/Gift_Card_App.git
```


```sh
git remote set-url origin <remote> # remote is git url to your repo.
git push origin main
```

2. Build the Docker Container
```sh
$ cd Gift_Card_APP

```

First, you'll need PostgreSQL running somewhere. You'll also need to make sure `pipenv` is installed. Then create a new file called `.env` in the root folder, and fill it with something like this:
```.env

SECRET_KEY=yellowpolkadotbikini
POSTGRES_USER=lemon
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=coolpassworddude
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```
$ docker-compose up --build


Now go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`. 

3. Authentication and Authorization
```sh

$ make sure to register and login to use the application
```
